            <h3>Campus security</h3>
            <p>
                First thing when you settle down at the campus is 
                to get the number of your campus security team. They usually offer 
                security escort service, especially after dark. If you have class at night, ask for
                their help. Again, don't be shy. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Know your surroundings</h3>
            <p>
                During orientation, ask which streets/areas are to be avoided. Call campus security to ask
                similar questions. Check with locals as well. <br>
                Always use well-lit streets with more crowd. Try get someone else to walk with you after
                dark. And Take Off yor earpieces!
